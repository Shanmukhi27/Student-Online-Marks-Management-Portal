# Student-Online-Marks-Management-Portal
It is the website where teachers can register students, enter, and edit the marks of students, and view the analysis, and rank list of students, students can view their report and the rank list.
I have built this platform using technologies like Reactjs, CSS for the front end, Expressjs, Nodejs for Backend, and MongoDB to store data. I used Axios for communication between the front end and the back end.

How to Run:

1. Open git bash in the frontend folder and run

npm start

2. Open git bash in the backend folder and run

nodemon index.js

About Project:

On the Home Page, you can find two options Teacher and Student. If he/she is a teacher, he/she will be asked to sign in (details initially stored in the database) and the teacher's email should be 6digits@teacher.schoolname.ac.in format. On the teacher's DashBoard RegisterStudents, Enter marks, Edit marks, Analysis, and view RankList options are shown we can click on them and select a class, section, and exam to enter, edit, see analysis, and view Ranklist. If students then in the student's dashboard they can find 2 options namely view progress report, and view rank list. They can click on them and they can select their class, and section, and enter their roll number to view their progress, rank list.
